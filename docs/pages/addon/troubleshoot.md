## My LSS StyleSheet Doesn't load

If it can happen that the LSS StyleSheet doesn't load, this is most commonly caused by a forgotten or misplaced semicolon (`;`) or curly bracket (`{`, `}`); the affected line should be printed to your log.
Try to search for those two cases. If you cannot find anything, feel free to ask for help on our <a href="https://labymod.net/dc/dev" target="_blank">development Discord</a> and <b>provide your LSS StyleSheet</b>.
